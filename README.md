[CN](./README_CN.md)

# Introduce

This repository is mainly used to record my leetcode exercises, algorithm templates, and other related exercises.

> You can submit a PR and share your better code with us (please use JavaScript/TypeScript)

# Format

When submitting code, you need to use the unified **prettier** rules for code formatting. For code formatting in batches, you can execute `npx prettier --write .`

# Data Structure

In TypeScript, there are no built-in implementations of common data structures such as queues and stacks. Therefore, we have provided some utility classes for data structures in the `structure` directory, which make it easy for me to use them when solving problems.

# Catalogue Introduction

It is planned to update the repository to use a TS project. Different directories represent different content, for example:

| Catalogue  | Abstract                                 |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| record     | leetcode topic collection                |
| structure  | TypeScript related data custom structure |
| experiment | Experiments with common problems         |

In addition, the project is connected to the jest code unit test. For jest-related content, you can view it in detail [jestjs.io](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)ã€‚
