# Introduce

This repository is mainly used to record my leetcode exercises

> You can submit a PR and share your better code with us (please use JavaScript/TypeScript)

# Format

When submitting code, you need to use the unified **prettier** rules for code formatting. For code formatting in batches, you can execute `npx prettier --write .`

# Data Structure

In TypeScript, there are no built-in implementations of common data structures such as queues and stacks. Therefore, we have provided some utility classes for data structures in the `structure` directory, which make it easy for me to use them when solving problems.
