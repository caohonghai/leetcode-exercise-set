# Introduce

This repository is mainly used to record my leetcode exercises

> You can submit a PR and share your better code with us (please use JavaScript/TypeScript)

When submitting code, you need to use the unified **prettier** rules for code formatting. For code formatting in batches, you can execute `npx prettier --write .`
